# Final-Project-2
This is the final draft of project 2 for BIMM 143

There are 6 .aln files. These are the clustal files containing the multiple sequence alignments of each gene. They are:
- prestin.aln
- GJB2.aln
- CDH23.aln
- PCDH15.aln
- OTOF.aln
- KCNQ4.aln

There are 6 .ph files. These are the phylip (newick) phylogenetic trees that correspond to each gene and alignment.
- prestin.ph
- GJB2.ph
- CDH23.ph
- PCDH15.ph
- OTOF.ph
- KCNQ4.ph

prestin.txt contains the raw sequences for all 6 species for the gene prestin (fasta file).

The project2-final.ipynb is the jupyter notebook for my project 2.

Project2-final.html is the html of my project.

### Scientific question: What genetic changes in the auditory processing pathway of mammals allow for high-frequency hearing, leading to the convergent evolution of echolocation?Â¶

### Scientific hypothesis: If there are similar changes in the sequences and expression of hearing-related genes in the brain of mammals, then an auditory processing pathway will evolve, allowing for the use of echolocation.
